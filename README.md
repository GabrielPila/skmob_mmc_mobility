# Mobilit Markov Chains with Skmob

This repo is an implementation of Mobility Markov Chains with the Scikit Mobility Library.

It focuses on the use of `Trajectory Data Frames`, a data structure part of skmob, to process geolocated information of an individual in order to generate a Mobility Markov Chain that represents its movement pattern.

# MMC Generation Process

The process is as follows:
1. Loading the gelocated information in a tdf format.
2. Point of Interest Generation (POIs):
  - Noise Filtering: to remove the points in movement
  - Detection of Stops: to identify points where the user spends more than N minutes
  - Compressing: to unify some of the stops and reduce the potential POIs.
  - Clustering: to generate clusters from the stops generated in a DBSCAN-like manner
3. POI assignment, where each point of the original tdf is assigned to a cluster, where possible.
4. Generation of the transition matrix, which shows the transition of the user among different clusters.
